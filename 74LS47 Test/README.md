#Using Makefile
To use makefile you use one of the following:
	**make
		*compile the whole thing
	**make clean
		*undo everything
	**make program
		*program the microcontroller using avr-dude

In order for make program to work you need to specify what programmer you are using by editing line 195 of the Makefile.

Enjoy!
