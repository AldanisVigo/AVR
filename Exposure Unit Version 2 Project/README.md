#Using Makefile

To use makefile you use one of the following:

1. __make__
	*compile the whole thing
2. __make__ clean
	*undo everything
3. __make program__
	*program the microcontroller using avr-dude

In order for make program to work you need to specify what programmer you are using by editing line 195 of the Makefile.

Enjoy!
